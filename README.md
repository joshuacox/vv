# vv
VV is a wrapper for command line tasks, it's most important feature is that it makes a noise when it is done, allowing me to background and do something else while the task completes, then I generally wrap some nice and ionice and /usr/bin/time -v into the command to make it nice and give me an idea of how long it took.  I added the time sync, to let me know how much of the above the kernel is trying to hide from me as well (of course the sync may reflect something else going on in the system, in any case I think it's a good idea to let the discs sync in general before other things commence and no need to alert me till afterwards)
