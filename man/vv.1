NAME
       vv - a wrapper around commans to make them politely run in the background and signal when they are done.

SYNOPSIS
       vv [options]

DESCRIPTION
       vv - a wrapper around commans to make them politely run in the background and signal when they are done.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help          Show this help message and exit.
       -v, --version       Show version information and exit.

USAGE

       just place vv at the start of your command line
       e.g.

       ```
       vv apt-get upgrade -y
       ```

       With a differing niceness:

       ```
       VV_NICENESS=10 vv echo one
       ```

       or (I’ll give some example output in this one)

       ```
       vv dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/testfile bs=1M count=4010     
       4010+0 records in
       4010+0 records out

       ### notes, caveats, troubleshooting

       There are some escaping issues that can be uncovered by throwing lot’s of interpretation snafu at it in $@
       i.e. I imagine I’ll have to throw some escape trickery in there at some point.  I’ll fix it when I run into one of those cases, but for now I’m using this daily without issue.
       I’m open to suggestions on better encapsulation inside the script

       some examples of how it might get borked are here:
       http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/57830/trouble-in-script-with-spaces-in-filename

       e.g. this works fine
       ```
       vv sudo cp -a 'VirtualBox VMs' /mnt/virtualbox/
       ```
       but this does not
       ```
       vv sudo cp -a VirtualBox\ VMs /mnt/virtualbox/
       ```
